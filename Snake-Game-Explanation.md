# Basic Snake Game using C++

This was a basic program I did to better my knowledge of C++.

Using the 3 part video series starting at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_-lMZDi7Uw , I learnt how to make a regular snake game.

This example taught me a few new features but helped me to better learn the basics of C++, althought the ned game is definetly not the greatest!
